Who doesnt like free stuff? specially, when it can increase your chances of increasing your salary and improving your resume. If you see yourself in cybersecurity industry and have the passion and drive to enter a demanding and rewarding field, or even if you are getting started, please take advantage of this opportunity.

(ISC)<sup>2</sup> is the world's largest nonprofit association of certified cybersecurity professionals and has commited to offer FREE certification in Cybersecurity (CC). It even includes free online self-paced training and the proctored exam to one million people. They are encouraging populations under-represented in cybersecurity by allocating half of the enrollments. If you are part of minority, your chances of getting the free certification increases, this includes:
- Women
- Person of color
- Hispanics
- Asians

There is a small catch though, after you have succesfully passed the exam, and endorsment (someone that accredits you has a capable individual who has relation with (ISC)<sup>2</sup>. For this case you can choose (ISC)<sup>2</sup> to be your endorser) you will have to pay a $50 annual membership fee and with that you'll become a certified member. 

If you are interested, I urge you to sign up as soon as possible in order to get one place before running out. For more information you can see the oficial website [here](https://www.isc2.org/1mcc).

I was fortunate to sign up and pass the exam and obtain the certification. The certification last for about 2 years but you can get Continuing Education credits to revalidate and extend the certification period.

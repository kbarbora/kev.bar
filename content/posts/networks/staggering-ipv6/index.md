At the moment, the IPv6 protocol is still seen as the eternal substitute for IPv4 to alleviate the problem of increasingly scarce Internet addresses. The true is that only a few people and companies are ready to support IPv6 despite being actively as Internet Standard since July 2017 (ignoring that it was developed in December 1998).

Yet one wonders how big the IPv6 address space is to guarantee that we won't run out of IPs again in another 40 years.
The address space of IPv6 is 2^128, that is to say of the order of 3.4*10^38 (340,282,366,920,938,463,463,374,607,431,768,211,456 IP addresses)

Let's see how big this IPv6 address space is:

- There are enough addresses to assign several thousand trillion IP addresses for every human being on the planet.
- An IP address could be assigned to every grain of sand on planet Earth, and there would still be a few left to assign.
- If we represented the IPv4 address space in a square 4 centimeters on a side, the square of IPv6 addresses would be about the size of our solar system.
- If, since planet Earth began to form, if IPs had been assigned at the rate of 1,000 million per second, not even one thousand billionth of the total address space would have been consumed.
- Taking into account the size of the Earth's surface and the current size of desktop computers, if each one had an IPv6 address, it would not be enough to cover the entire surface of the Earth (seas included) with PCs to exhaust the IP addresses, but rather that they would have to be stacked one on top of the other to form columns 10,000 million PCs high.

I hope I have cleared up the doubts of readers who thought that thanks to IPv6 we would last a few more decades before exhausting all IPs.
